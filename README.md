## Wingz & Things Order Form
<img src="Screenshot.jpg" width="300">
In this exercise I created an online food order form that allows you to select the food you would like to order.  Made use of input boxes for you to input your name for the order and to add any other instruction for the order.  Also made use of select input to allow you to make a selection from a drop down menu. 

Future improvments to this exercise is to add click effect to buttons and add a hover message when you hover over the input box.
